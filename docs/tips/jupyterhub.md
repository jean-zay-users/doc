# Using UI interfaces through JupyterHub

Since december 2022, Idris proposes to their users to launch jobs in Jean Zay using an UI
interface accessible through JupyterHub. This interface is available from:
https://jupyterhub.idris.fr .  

!!! warning
    The url is only available from an IP address already registered in the Idris
    database.  You need your password and username in order to log in. 
    
Using this tool will allow you to, for example, launch Jupyter notebooks that can run in multiple nodes/GPUs, using Dask with an UI and start logging facilities (e.g., Tensorflow, MLFlow).

Full documentation for this feature is [available here](http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/pre-post/jean-zay-jupyterhub.html).
