# Using UI interfaces through JupyterHub

Since december 2022, Idris proposes to their users to launch jobs in Jean Zay using an UI
interface accessible through JupyterHub. This interface is available from:
https://jupyterhub.idris.fr .  The url is only available from an IP address
already registered in the Idris database.  You need your password and username
in order to log in. Using this tool will allow you to, for example, launch
Jupyter notebooks, using Dask and start logging facilities (Tensorflow, MLFlow).

[Full documentation for this feature is available here](http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/pre-post/jean-zay-jupyterhub.html).
