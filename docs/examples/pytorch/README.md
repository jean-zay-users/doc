# PyTorch examples

To run these scripts you will need to clone the jean-zay-doc repo in your
`$WORK` dir and go to corresponding folder. Follow instructions detalied inside
each folder:
```
cd $WORK &&\
git clone https://github.com/jean-zay-users/jean-zay-doc.git
```

## MNIST

In this tutorial you will learn to train a *basic CNN model* and tune its
hyperparameters on Jean Zay using **Slurm Batch** and **Slurm Job Array**. Two
implementations are available: single GPU and multi GPU.

## Distributed STL10

This example will show you how to train a *ResNet18* in a distributed setting
(multi GPU and multi node) on the Jean Zay infrastructure using **Slurm srun**.
