## MNIST

In this tutorial you will learn to train a *basic CNN model* and tune its hyperparameters
on the Jean Zay infrastructure using **Slurm Batch** and **Slurm Job Array**.

## Distributed STL10

In this tutorial you will learn to train a *ResNet18* in a distributed setting (multi GPU and multi node) on 
the Jean Zay infrastructure using **Slurm srun**.
