# Tips and Tricks

## Python

### Install miniconda (recommended solution if you are already familiar with conda)

Install `miniconda` in `$WORK/miniconda3`:

```bash
# download Miniconda installer
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
# install Miniconda
MINICONDA_PATH=$WORK/miniconda3
chmod +x miniconda.sh && ./miniconda.sh -b -p $MINICONDA_PATH
# make sure conda is up-to-date
source $MINICONDA_PATH/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda update --yes conda
# Update your .bashrc to initialise your conda base environment on each login
conda init
```

If you run out of space or inodes on `$WORK` (`irdquota -w` can help you
figuring out whether you are close to the limit) you can send an email to
[assist@idris.fr](mailto:assist@idris.fr) and ask for an increase. Try
something between 5x-10x with some small justification and that should go
through without too much problem (if that's not the case, open an
[issue](https://github.com/jean-zay-users/jean-zay-doc/issues/new) to improve
this doc!).

### How to launch an interactive job

Your can use `srun` to launch an interactive job.

For example, if you want to use a node with 4 GPUs during 1 hour, you can type:

```bash
srun --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=40 --gres=gpu:4 --time=01:00:00 --qos=qos_gpu-dev --pty bash -i
```

Now, you have a brand new shell on a compute node where you can run your scripts interactively
during 1h.

### Overview of cluster usage

```bash
sinfo -p gpu_p1,gpu_p2 -o"%P %.16F"
```

Output is something like this:

```bash
PARTITION   NODES(A/I/O/T)
gpu_p1      258/0/2/260
gpu_p2       15/16/0/31
```

A = allocated, I = idle, O = other, T = total

### How to connect to the node of a launched GPU job

You can directly connect to a node used by one of your jobs with SSH:

```bash
ssh node-name
```
You can get the `node-name` information from the `squeue -u $USER` command. For example, `r7in10`
or `jean-zay-ia816` are valid node names.

If you don't have a job running on the node you will get an error like this:

```bash
Access denied by pam_slurm_adopt: you have no active jobs on this node
Connection closed by 10.148.8.45 port 22
```

Caveat (September 2020) : if you have multiple jobs running on the same node it
is not possible to specify which job you want to connect to.

Have a look at the [official
doc](http://www.idris.fr/eng/jean-zay/jean-zay-connexion_ssh_noeud_calcul-eng.html)
about this as well.

### Auto Requeue on timeouts

Sometimes you want your script to run longer than the maximum walltime of a particular Slurm queue, for example
if you want to train a model for more than 1 day on the `gpu_p1` queue or more than 5 days on the `gpu_p2` queue.
One work-around for this use case is to take a snapshot of your model regularly and automatically relaunch a job 
(and start from this snapshot) once it reaches the maximum walltime limit.

It is possible to ask Slurm to send a signal before the job timeouts, handle it in Python and automatically
requeue a similar job.

You need to add the following to your Slurm shell: 

```bash
#SBATCH --signal=USR1@20   # asks SLURM to send the USR1 signal 20 seconds before end of the time limit
```

And handle the signal in Python:

```python
import os
import socket
import signal
import sys
import logging

from pathlib import Path

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def sig_handler(signum, frame):
    logger.warning("Signal handler called with signal " + str(signum))
    prod_id = int(os.environ['SLURM_PROCID'])
    logger.warning("Host: %s - Global rank: %i" % (socket.gethostname(), prod_id))
    if prod_id == 0:
        logger.warning("Requeuing job " + os.environ['SLURM_JOB_ID'])
        os.system('scontrol requeue ' + os.environ['SLURM_JOB_ID'])
    else:
        logger.warning("Not the master process, no need to requeue.")
    sys.exit(-1)


def init_signal_handler():
    """
    Handle signals sent by SLURM for time limit.
    """
    signal.signal(signal.SIGUSR1, sig_handler)
    logger.warning("Signal handler installed.")

...
# In main

# Makes sure that we start from where we ended in the previous job
checkpoint = Path("my_job.pt")
if checkpoint.exists():
    load(checkpoint)

init_signal_handler()

for _ in range(epochs):
    ...
    save(checkpoint)

```

!!! warning
    Remember to also add a serialization logic to your objects to make sure
    your new job start from where your previous job ended. In the above case,
    we will restart from the previous epoch checkpoint.

## Miscellaneous

### Managing your data and the storage spaces

Be careful about the place where you put your data on the JZ super-computer,
since there are quotas for each project, depending on the storage space and the
number of files (inodes) that you use. Additionally, some spaces are temporary.

There is a detailed description of the storage spaces [here](http://www.idris.fr/jean-zay/cpu/jean-zay-cpu-calculateurs-disques.html).

Briefly:

- `$HOME` (3Gb) -> for config files.
- `$WORK` (limited on inodes) -> for code, (small) databases.
- `$SCRATCH` (very large limits, temporary) -> output data, large databases
- `$STORE` (large space, occasional consultation)  -> permanent large databases.
- `$DSDIR` (popular databases on demand).

It is worth noting that `$SCRATCH` consists of a farm of SSD storage
devices and it provides the best performance in reading/writing operations.
You must also be aware that `$SCRATCH` is regularly "cleaned": files that
have not been accessed (i.e. at least read) for 30 days are definitely
removed. So you **risk to lose your data** if your keep it there without using it.

You can consult your disk quota anytime with the command `idrquota` (see
`idrquota -h`). If you need more space or inodes on your personal spaces
(`$WORK` or `$STORE`), just ask the support team at
[assist@idris.fr](mailto:assist@idris.fr).

If you need to send data to Jean-Zay a good idea is to use `rsync`. E.g.:

```bash
rsync -avz /your/local/database/ your-jean-zay-login@jean-zay:/gpfsscratch/your/remote/dir/
```

### Connect seamlessly from your local machine

Add local your public ssh key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` of your account on the jean-zay cluster.
Your local public ssh key can be found in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

In your local ssh configuration, found in `~/.ssh/config`, you can also add the following:

```bash
Host jz
hostname jean-zay.idris.fr
user <user-name>
```

To connect to the jean-zay cluster you will then just need to do `ssh jz`.

### Clone git repo

SSH from Jean Zay going to the outside is very restricted. That means that if
you are used to do

bash
git clone git@my-institute-gitlab.fr:/my-organisation/my-repo.git
```
it will not work on Jean Zay (very likely it will time out after some time).

Instead you should use HTTPS instead i.e. something like:

```bash
git clone https://my-institute-gitlab.fr:/my-organisation/my-repo.git
```

In order to avoid having to type your password too often (on each `git push`)
you can set up password caching like this:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
# by default password is cached for 15 minutes but you can increase it if you want
git config --global credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600"
```

If for some reason, you do absolutely need SSH access from Jean Zay to an
outside server, you need to fill out this form:
http://www.idris.fr/media/data/formulaires/fgc.pdf, mostly the section "Ajout,
modification ou suppression de machines".
